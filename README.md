## Welcome! 👋
 " QR code component " challenge from Frontend Mentor. In this challenge, HTML and CSS were used to create a responsive and accessible QR code component  component. 
### Semantic Elements
Semantic HTML elements were used to structure the content and provide meaningful information to assistive technologies and search engines. This improves the accessibility and maintainability of the code.

### Class Naming Conventions
The Vim methodology was employed for naming classes. This naming convention ensures consistent and scalable naming across the project. It helps in organizing and managing CSS styles more effectively.

### Responsive Design
The product preview card component is designed to be responsive, which means it adapts and displays well on different devices and screen sizes. Media queries and CSS flexbox/grid layouts were utilized to achieve a fluid and responsive design.

### Accessibility
Accessibility considerations were taken into account to ensure that the product preview card component can be used and understood by a wide range of users, including those with disabilities. Proper alt text for images, appropriate contrast ratios, and ARIA attributes were used where necessary.

### Files and Folders Structure
The project files and folders are organized in a structured manner for easy navigation and maintenance. Here is an overview of the file structure:
- ├── `index.html`           # The main HTML file
- ├── `styles.css`           # The main CSS file
- ├── `images/`              # Folder containing product images
- └── `design/ `           # Folder containing design images
- └── `README.md `           # Documentation file
